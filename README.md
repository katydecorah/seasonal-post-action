# Seasonal post action

A GitHub action that creates a seasonal post from data files generated by [read-action](https://github.com/katydecorah/read-action), [bookmark-action](https://github.com/katydecorah/bookmark-action), and [spotify-to-yaml-action](https://github.com/katydecorah/spotify-to-yaml-action).

If you're including playlist data generated by the spotify-to-yaml-action, you'll want to make sure it's schedule to run before this action.

## Template

This action comes with a default [markdown template](.github/actions/seasonal-post-template.md) to generate the seasonal post. You can create your own template to completely customize the page.

You can use all [LiquidJS](https://liquidjs.com/index.html) syntax to compose the page.

### Template data

- `season` - Current season. Example: `Fall`
- `year` - Current year. Example: `2024`
- `books` - Array of books pulled from [read-action](https://github.com/katydecorah/read-action) for the season. A few exceptions in the data: `link` is renamed to `url` and `authors` is a comma delimited string.
- `playlist` - Object pulled from [spotify-to-yaml-action](https://github.com/katydecorah/spotify-to-yaml-action) for the season.
- `bookmarks` - Array of objects pulled from [bookmark-action](https://github.com/katydecorah/bookmark-action) for the season.

### Template filters

In addition to [LiquidJS](https://liquidjs.com/index.html) functionality, there are a couple custom filters:

The `yaml` will return the data formatted in yaml. This is helpful if you want to include the data in the file frontmatter:

Input:

```liquid
{{books  | yaml }}
```

Output:

```yaml
- title: Book title
  authors: Author Name, Author Name
  isbn: 1234567890
  description: Book description.
- title: Book title
  authors: Author Name, Author Name
  isbn: 1234567890
  description: Book description.
```

The `yaml` filter with arguments will only return the listed key names for the input data:

Input:

```liquid
{{books  | yaml: 'title','authors' }}
```

Output:

```yaml
- title: Book title
  authors: Author Name, Author Name
- title: Book title
  authors: Author Name, Author Name
```

The `yaml` filter along with the `name` filter will return all data formatted in yaml and place the data under `recipes` property.

Input:

```liquid
{{books  | yaml: 'title','authors' | name: 'bookShelf' }}
```

Output:

```yaml
bookShelf:
  - title: Book title
    authors: Author Name, Author Name
  - title: Book title
    authors: Author Name, Author Name
```
