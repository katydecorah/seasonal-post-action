# Seasonal post action

A GitHub action that creates a seasonal post from data files generated by [read-action](https://github.com/katydecorah/read-action), [bookmark-action](https://github.com/katydecorah/bookmark-action), and [spotify-to-yaml-action](https://github.com/katydecorah/spotify-to-yaml-action).

If you're including playlist data generated by the spotify-to-yaml-action, you'll want to make sure it's schedule to run before this action.

## Template

This action comes with a default [markdown template](.github/actions/seasonal-post-template.md) to generate the seasonal post. You can create your own template to completely customize the page.

You can use all [LiquidJS](https://liquidjs.com/index.html) syntax to compose the page.

### Template data

- `season` - This is the current season.
- `books` - This is the array of books pulled from [read-action](https://github.com/katydecorah/read-action) for the season. A few exceptions in the data:
  - `link` is renamed to `url`
  - `authors` is a comma deliminated string.
- `playlist` - This is an object pulled from [spotify-to-yaml-action](https://github.com/katydecorah/spotify-to-yaml-action) for the season.
- `bookmarks` - This is an array of objects pulled from [bookmark-action](https://github.com/katydecorah/bookmark-action) for the season.
- `year` - The current year.
- `image` - An image file path.

### Template filters

In addition to LiquidJS filters, there are a couple custom filters:

This will return all bookmarks formatted in yaml:

```
{{bookmarks  | yaml }}
```

This will return all bookmarks formatted in yaml, but will only return the listed key names.

{{bookmarks  | yaml: 'title','site','url','image' }}

This will return all bookmarks formatted in yaml, but will only return the listed key names and place it under `recipes`.

{{bookmarks  | yaml: 'title','site','url','image' | name: 'recipes' }}
