# Scheduled post action

A GitHub action that creates a scheduled post from data files generated by [read-action](https://github.com/katydecorah/read-action), [bookmark-action](https://github.com/katydecorah/bookmark-action), and [spotify-to-yaml-action](https://github.com/katydecorah/spotify-to-yaml-action).

If you're including playlist data generated by the spotify-to-yaml-action, you'll want to make sure it's schedule to run before this action.

## Action options

- `github-username`: Required. The GitHub username that owns the repository with the data files.

- `github-repository`: Required. The Github repository that has the data files.

- `posts-directory`: The path to where you want to save your scheduled post files to in this repository. Default: `notes/_posts/`.

- `post-template`: If you'd like to customize the [markdown template](src/template.md), define a path to your own. Example: `post-template: .github/actions/post-template.md`. The markdown template shows all the available variables and an idea for how you may want to format this file. For now, the templating is simplistic and does not offer functionality outside of this action replacing variable names.

- `source-books`: Define the label and file path for the books data generated by [read-action](https://github.com/katydecorah/read-action). Separate the label and file path with a pipe (`|`). If you do not have books, set this value to `false`. Note: this value will **not** change the variable name in the markdown template, which is `bookYaml` and `bookMarkdown`. Default: `books|_data/read.json`.

- `source-bookmarks`: Define the label and file path for the bookmarks data generated by [bookmark-action](https://github.com/katydecorah/bookmark-action). Separate the label and file path with a pipe (`|`). If you do not have bookmarks, set this value to `false`. Note: this value will **not** change the variable name in the markdown template, which is `bookmarkYaml` and `bookmarkMarkdown`. Default: `bookmarks|_data/bookmarks.json`.

- `source-playlist`: Define the file path for the playlist data generated by [spotify-to-yaml-action](https://github.com/katydecorah/spotify-to-yaml-action). If you do not have playlists, set this value to `false`. Default: `_data/playlists.yml`.

- `book-tags`: Allow specific tags to be passed through. Separate each tag with a comma.
