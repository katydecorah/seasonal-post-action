    "description": "Schnitzel is a way of preparing thin slices of meat by breading and frying them until crisp While the popular Viennese dish is traditionally made with thinly pounded veal, here, pounded pork cutlets are breaded and baked on a sheet pan — rather than fried in a skillet — until golden for an easy weeknight meal The key to perfectly brown breadcrumbs is the addition of a few dollops of mayonnaise, which helps the coating crisp up during baking",
