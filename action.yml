  SeasonalPostTemplate:
    description: "If you'd like to customize the [markdown template](src/template.md), define a path to your own. Example: `SeasonalPostTemplate: .github/actions/seasonal-post-template.md`. The markdown template shows all the available variables and an idea for how you may want to format this file. For now, the templating is simplistic and does not offer functionality outside of this action replacing variable names."
